# Phu-Quoc-travel-Things-to-know
Phú Quốc (pronounce: foo kwuck) is a large tropical island off the coast of Cambodia, though is part of, and only accessible from, Vietnam.

About Phu Quoc
Phú Quôc is still what Phuket would be, if it hadn’t been overrun by development. Phú Quôc island and its beaches was voted to be “The Cleanest and Most Beautiful Beach of the World” by ABC News as from the end of February, 2008, however, this is over now. Phú Quôc has a severe domestic waste problem, every single beach is littered with plastic waste of originating from the island itself and from tourist boats. Only those beaches cleaned once or twice daily by hotel staff are clean.
Extensive plans to develop Phú Quôc are being implemented, including high-rise residential areas, several new towns and suburbs, a socialist style holiday resort covering a large stretch of previous forest in the Northwest of the island, and complete rebuilding of Duong Dông’s city center. In April 2016, much of the northern part of the island was a construction site, with worker’s camp at numerous locations. The new internatonal airport south of Duong Dông has replaced the small domestic Phu Quoc airport further up north. The main north-south road between Bai Thom and An Thoi is already being upgraded to a 2+2 lane highway, a new tared road from Duong Dông to Ganh Dau is ready. A golf area is planned as well as a casino in the north. A ferry connection to Sihanoukville (Cambodia) is still an illusion.
